## About
  Hi there! I'm currently a student at Oregon State, while also working as a Administrative Technology Specialist at North Penn School District. Things you may find on my Github consist of random personal projects as well as a collection of school portfolio assignments that were immediately abandoned upon being graded that are filled with spaghetti (hopefully less so as time goes on). 
  My homelab setup consists of a Dell R720 and 2x Dell R210 II's, as well as an older repurposed Ryzen 5 1600 desktop build. I run them in a cluster using the Proxmox VE virtualization platform. Some of the services I run or Pihole for adblocking & local DNS purposes, various web servers for projects, game servers for my friends, and many others. The pièce de résistance is my routing setup. I run a virtualized instance of the pfSense firewall which is replicated across three of the servers in the cluster in a high-availabilty configuration.
